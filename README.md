## Kurelog

Thank you for using kurelog for all this time, unfortunately due to my lost interest in sinoalice, i made this source code public so anyone can use it

Database example was found at kurelog.sql

use Laravel 8 to operate, migration folder may be not accurate so i am apologize for any spaghetti code i made

for any information regards can send dm to VClude#4666 discord

This application was made for sorting messy battle log given by sinoalice into individual like what sinoalice does nowadays, feature that i know has been made is

- Individual Grid viewer, Swap grid support
- Buff/Debuff Specific 
- Grancolo Rank
- Integration with discord ID to specific guild so each guild battle log are distinct between user 
- Shinma Contributor
- shown user Buff/Debuff/Attack Targeting 
- Individual Weapon Analysis
- etc, i even forgot what inside completely lol
